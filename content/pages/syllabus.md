description: 'This course will cover the basic mathematics and physics of oscillatory
  andwave phenomena. Content-wise,

  by the end of the course, students should be able to explainwhy oscillations appear
  in many near equilibrium

  systems, the various mathematical properties of those oscillations in various contexts,
  how oscillations and

  waves are related, and the basic mathematical description and properties of a wave.
  Skill-wise, students

  should become adept at translating conceptual understanding into mathematical explanations,
  writing short

  programs to solve analytical systems, and developing clear questions about physical
  systems.'
