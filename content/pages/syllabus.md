### **Course Meeting Times**

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Recitations: 1 session / week,  1 hour / session.  Attending recitation is mandatory.

### **Prerequisites**

With regard to mathematics, students should be proficient in algebra, matrix addition/multiplication, trigonometry, analytic geometry, and basic differentiation/integration. With regard to physics, students should have had prior exposure to and practice with Newton’s laws of motion, 1D kinematics, 2D projectile motion, and conservation of energy/momentum.

### **Description**

This course will cover the basic mathematics and physics of oscillatory andwave phenomena. Content-wise, by the end of the course, students should be able to explain why oscillations appear in many near equilibrium systems, the various mathematical properties of those oscillations in various contexts, how oscillations and waves are related, and the basic mathematical description and properties of a wave. Skill-wise, students should become adept at translating conceptual understanding into mathematical explanations, writing short programs to solve analytical systems, and developing clear questions about physical systems.

### **Online Resources and Notes**

The course will not have a formal textbook. However, many useful references can be found online.
