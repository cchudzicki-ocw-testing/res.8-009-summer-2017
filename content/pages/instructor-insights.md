## Curriculum Information

### Prerequisites

With regard to mathematics, students should be proficient in algebra, matrix addition/multiplication, trigonometry, analytic geometry, and basic differentiation/integration. With regard to physics, students should have had prior exposure to and practice with Newton’s laws of motion, 1D kinematics, 2D projectile motion, and conservation of energy/momentum.

### Requirements Satisfied

Students in the MITES summer program take one physics course in addition to courses in life science, calculus, humanities, and engineering. *Introduction to Oscillations and Waves* is one of the courses that meet the program's physics requirement.

### Offered

Occasionally

## Assessment

There are no formal grades in the MITES summer program, but students do receive numerical grades on their assignments and exams so that they and the instructors can track their progress. 

## Student Information

About half the students were Africans from the continent or first-generation Americans of African background. Many of the non-African students were going to be working in Africa during the summer or had recently spent time there.
